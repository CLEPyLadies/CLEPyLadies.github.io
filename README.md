# What is PyLadies?

Cleveland PyLadies is a local chapter of PyLadies. We are an open and inclusive Python user group explicitly focused on engaging women and underrepresented populations in tech, specifically in and around Northeast Ohio. We are a local chapter of the global Pyladies organization.

## Connect with us!

We currently have 3 active organizers that can be reached directly (cle at pyladies dot com) for questions. We are on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/CLEPyLadies), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/clepyladies/), & [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/CLEPyLadies) as CLEPyLadies. We also love to promote local bloggers on [our Medium publication](https://medium.com/cleveland-pyladies). Check out our upcoming events on [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/CLE-PyLadies/)!

We have channels on two Slack workspaces: [PyLadies global](slackin.pyladies.com) (as #Cleveland) and the [Cleveland Tech](cleveland-tech.slack.com) (as #CLE-PyLadies). The local slack also has a #CLEpy channel for the general [Cleveland Python User Group](https://www.clepy.org/).

### Speak at our meetup

We have a [papercall.io event page](https://www.papercall.io/clepyladies) for submitting talk proposals. You can also reach out to us on Slack or by email if you would like to have a conversation about the topic you have in mind. We aim to stream at least 30 minutes of each meetup on our YouTube channel to facilitate remote participation by the mothers and working women in our community, but can work around any speaker privacy concerns.
